            <div>
              <p>Hello! My name is Ayush Bandopadhyay, a student at Dublin High School. As a student,
              I currently want to become an engineer or designer after college. My goals are to pass high school with an Advanced
              Scholar Diploma and to attend one of the Ivy League Universities here in California. I plan on achieving my goal by
              studying hard for assessments of my skill, and by continuing to aspire I will get closer and closer to my career in
              college and beyond. This is my career choice for many reasons. As a child, I have seen my father go through many jobs, 
              each one a software engineer at different companies like PayPal and Apple. After days sitting next to him working on 
              his laptop, I was inspired to follow in his footsteps.</p>
              <p>I have many skills that I have acquired over time. I am able to display my creative abilities in art, design, and 
              engineering. Along with that, I am able to learn new concepts and skills on my own and apply them, just like this website, 
              displaying my abilities in HTML and CSS. Finally, I am very good at continuing with my work. No matter what obstacles I 
              come across I deliver, in a group, I am a team player and work well in taking the lead and getting work done. At school 
              in the short time that I have attended, I have achieved some things, such as maintaining honor roll, getting into Advanced 
              English, and also taking Algebra 2 with Trigonometry as a freshman.</p>
              <p>In the workspace, there is no block to my creativity and performance. If there is a job that needs to be done, I will get
              it done on time. Over the years of working with different types of groups and partners, I have learned to cope with people and
              make the experience productive. Some of my achievements include Honor Roll for all of my education, taking higher level math
              classes, getting on the Pleasanton Seahawks Swim Team, and receiving Gifted and Talented Education status.</p>
