            <p>Hello! My name is Ayush Bandopadhyay, a student, and aspiring inventor at Dublin High School. Find out more about me here. As a student, I currently want to become an engineer or designer after college. My goals are to pass high school with an Advanced Scholar Diploma, and to attend one of the Ivy League Universities here in California. I plan on achieving my goal by studying hard for assessments of my skill, and by continuing to aspire I will get closer and closer to my career in college and beyond. This is my career choice for many reasons. As a child I have seen my father go through many jobs, each one a software engineer at different companies like PayPal and Apple. After days sitting next to him working on his laptop, I was inspired to follow in his footsteps.</br>

	</br> I have many skills that I have acquired over time. I am able to display my creative abilities in art, design and engineering.(ex:img(legos, vex, sculpture). Along with that I am able to learn new concepts and skills on my own and apply them. (Website). Finally, I am very good at continuing with my work. No matter what obstacles I come across I deliver, in a group I am a team player and work well in taking the lead and getting work done. At school in the short time that I have attended I have achieved some things, such as maintaining honor roll, getting into Advanced English, and also taking Algebra 2 with Trig as Freshman.</br>

	</br> In the workspace there is no block to my creativity and performance. If there is a job that needs to be done, I will get it done on time. Over the years of working with different types of groups and partners I have learned to cope with people and make the experience productive.
