            <p class="py-5">The main goal of this project was to show our programming skills in block based code through Scratch by creating a game with my partners, Huan and Oleg, then customizing and documenting it. My partners and I decided to try something different and we created a 2D obstacle course game. We created something like Mario, so we named our project Mariooooo 2. Our game can be controlled by the arrows keys, and uses space to attack. The goal is simple, get to the door. The main work I did was the animations with characters, weapons, and the levels. Together, after weeks of work, trying to get the game work as smoothly as possible, we reached our goal. </p>
